# Hyyker

## About

Track all of your favorite hikes and activities! This app was built with a Rails API backend and hooked up to a JQuery frontend. I had a lot of fun making this app and learned a ton, and in the near future I hope to  add more features from 3rd Party APIs like Google Maps and Yelp.

## Usage

* You can access a live demo of the app [here](http://hyyker.club)
* Or you can clone the repo locally
* Make sure to `cd` into the repository:

```
  cd hyyker
```

* Run `bundle install`
* Run `rails s` to start up your server
* Head on over to your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and start adding some hikes!
